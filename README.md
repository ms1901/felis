# Felis
Prototyping Interactive Systems project
This  code includes the working of ultrasonic and IR sensors.
The ultrasonic detects the proximity of the user and lights up the face and outer parts of the lion
The IR sensors are used to light the blocks and change colours of the block if they are already lit up.


Felis is a piece of art with which one can humanly interact. Putting together the world of art and interaction, we have come up with the idea of a beautiful lion painting.

  The lion is represented in a geometric form with its mane acting like prompts that initiate color changes allowing the user to color the lion the way they desire. The eyes of the lion also change color according to the proximity of the viewer from the installation.

  The majestic lion in the form of a light interaction is a visual bliss to one and all. The painting is for those who love art, those who get inspired by the ferocious creature-the lion, to come and enjoy and get mesmerized by its beauty.

Because this installation allows the viewer to interact with some of its elements, it provides the viewer a very varied experience from (say) a traditional painting or sculpture, which is normally seen from a single reference.

This installation art is a pure work of art, and its impact, message, and beauty will remain with the viewer forever.
